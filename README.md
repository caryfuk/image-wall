==========

Fullscreen image viewer app based on Dan Abramov's react-hot-boilerplate.

This is WIP in very early stage.

### Usage

```
npm install
export FLICKR_KEY=your-key
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### To be done soon
 - all requests should be handled by one express/(hapi?) instance
 - add input / voice control
 - allow both grid and slideshow mode
 - try using Rx streams for handling with interaction
