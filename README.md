Image wall
=====================

Fullscreen image viewer app based on Dan Abramov's react-hot-boilerplate.

This is WIP in very early stage.

### Usage

```
npm install
export FLICKR_KEY=your-key
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### To be done soon
 - meaningful components structure - list, image, search widget
 - better route handling (listening for url changes, using browser history api)
 - adding some style preprocessor
